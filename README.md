My goal with this repository is to better understand the exact math that's happening in neurons inside of a neural network.

I'm coding this library while reading Andrew Trask's book Grokking Deep Learning. Many of the unit tests in this library are based on examples in his book. The code is based on his book, as well as tutorials from:
